# [Para](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cFP01W_GVi3ZroX8GKrivVUAC7z0XRMCps8WOA8Pjrk/edit?usp=sharing)
An android mobile app that answers any question in one paragraph or less using GPT-3

The API key used in this project is no longer valid (rotated out of use because of publishing to GitHub), but it can be replaced with a valid key to use the app:
- In para/app/src/main/java/com/ait/para/retrofit/GPT3API.kt
- `@Headers("Content-Type: application/json", "Authorization: Bearer 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")`
- Replace the API key ("Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY")

Enjoy!
